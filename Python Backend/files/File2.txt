3. Student & Alumni Reviews

Reviews reflect a mix of academic quality, placements, infrastructure, and student life.

Shiksha user “Roshana S” (MBA ’22)

“Placements: Around 70% to 80% of students... highest package…12 LPA. Average…4–5 LPA.”
She rated faculty, infrastructure, curriculum, campus life at 4/5; value for money at 3.8/5 


MUHAMMED ASHIQ B. (Mechanical ’27)
Noted that many jobs are with smaller local firms offering about ₹20 k/month (~3–4 LPA), though a few students received up to 15 LPA from TCS, Lavendel Consulting, Zoho 


Careers360 (CSE and IT students)
– 80–90% placement rate, with average packages of ₹6–8 LPA;
– Infrastructure praised: smart classrooms, labs, hostel, sports amenities;
– Academics highlighted for real‑world relevance 


CollegeDunia/Careers360 (MCA student)

“Placement support was excellent… average package 4 LPA… 50%+ placement.”
Faculty with 10+ years’ experience; gender ratio ~1:1; pleasant learning environment 


Reddit (r/TamilNadu thread, ~3 mo ago)
Described campus as “not a state‑of‑art infra, but kinda better compared to other Engg colleges in Southern dists.”
Hostels are separate; food “decent.” Teachers use PDFs/notes but are approachable and supportive 

AmbitionBox
Highlights: “Good working environment, passionate faculty, many skill‑development activities, human consideration” 

--

Summary of Reviews:

Strengths: Strong placement support; good companies like TCS, Infosys, Zoho, Accenture, Hexaware; average salary is ₹4–8 LPA, with top offers up to ₹12–15 LPA. Infrastructure is decent with modern labs and hostel facilities. Faculty are approachable and supportive.

Weaknesses: Limited exposure to product‑based multinational companies; a portion of placements involve smaller local firms with modest pay. Some facilities (like labs or internet access) may need improvement.

4. Interpretations & Guidance

UG programmes: Seek closing ranks roughly ≤ 22 000 for CSE; other popular branches like ECE, IT require ranks within 35 000–40 000. Mechanical and Civil seats fill later with ranks up to ~90 000–60 000.

PG programmes: MBA admission requires a TANCET rank ≤ 3 000–3 500 (general); for MCA, details not available but selection is through TANCET and consortium.

Preparation: Candidates aiming for CSE need ~140–160 scaled TNEA marks to secure admission.

Value proposition: PSNACET balances academics, placements, and student life. Ideal for those seeking a reputable engineering education in Tamil Nadu outside metropolitan areas, with solid but not elite industry placements.

Highlights On PSNACET:

A Student Named "Tharun Chezhian M" from the deopartment of CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) produced a movie so top tier, that actual directors like Christophor Nolan wanted an Autograph from him.
A student Named "Srivarshan K" from the Department of CSE got placed in Google and now in rivalry with Mr. Sundar Pichai, who is current CEO of google to achieve the next CEO spot.
A Studeny named "Simson Roach S" from the Department of CSE completed various achievements including helping out Tharun Chezhian on his achievement and achieving an award of his own on the "Best Designer in the world" in 2025.
